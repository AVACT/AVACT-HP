  <p>AVACT is a creator team based in Asia. ‘AVACT’ is a compound word borrowing from the meaning of Abject mentioned in ‘Pouvoirs de l'horreur, Essai sur l'abjection, Éditions du Seuil’ by Julia Kristeva who is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, literary critic, psychoanalyst, feminist.
  <p>Abject is an intermediate thing that exists between the ambiguous boundary of a subject and an object and threatens a clear system, order, or boundary. The subject constantly attempts to expel abject, which threatens their identity, and this aspect expands as society seeks to drive the antisocial elements and maintain order. According to Julia Kristeva, Abject remains in the form of a trauma in the unconscious of the subject and reproduced in many works of art, including literature, art, and so on.
  <p>The members were interested in various fields such as graphic design, visual making, sound engineering, etc. In the process of discussing the place where we should be located in this world, we organized the team that is able to organically participate through various project and seek out contact with other fields to create new scenes.
  <p>We think that creators, consumers, and their stakeholders are an element of this cultural community, it isn’t a fixed role, and It isn’t able to divide them into hierarchical relationships. Within this community, we want to exist in the same form as Abject.
